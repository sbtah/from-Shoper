# Simple app that loads all products from SHOPER Api and then creates products on SHOPIFY platform.


Currently my company is starting a branch in USA. On European market we are running a store via Shoper platform, but for US market we decided to go with Shopify.
Although, I could import all our products via csv file, I decided to create an API import program, that will do some cleaning on the data.
